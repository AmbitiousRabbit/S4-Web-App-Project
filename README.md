# S4-Web-App-Project -- Sprint-4

Hey there! 👋🙂 

Welcome to my hopefully-not-too-chaotic realm of a coding project where I'll show you what I was capable of conjuring up with my new ✨software development tools✨ 😎💻🖱️ So come on in. Watch your step and let's go on an adventure and see what light you can shed upon this Kaggle dataset I found that's based on Spotify's Most Streamed Songs of 2023. So hopefully, you like music and are curious to see how I had shaped, manipulated and displayed this data. Any positive feedback is appreciated, so thanks in advance!

Here's the link: https://spotifys-2023-top-charting-music-and.onrender.com    | The Local link (via from the Terminal is this): http://localhost:8501    | Although I do wanna say, I'm sorry once again that the visuals aren't showing well based on what I had in mind.

Also another thing to note is: this is just a tool to simulate random events on any insights or findings I found regarding the dataset.

If you'd like to run all of this locally, here's what you can do:
In terms of the Environment, please install the following libraries and their specific versions:
- altair==5.2.0
- matplotlib==3.8.2
- pandas==2.2.0
- plotly==5.18.0
- plotly-express==0.4.1
- streamlit==1.31.0
- python==3.10.13 ** (this one is paramount cause I had a lot of issues for whatever reason when trying to use the above libraries with the latest vr of python)

I am also using the MiniConda as my environment. Furthermore, anything else you should need will be apart of the folder. 

This should be everything you need to set up your environment, so please proceed!
